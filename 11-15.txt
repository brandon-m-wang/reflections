Distribute bonuses

def getBonuses(performance):
	count = len(performance)
	bonus = [1] * count
	
	for i in range(1, count):
		if performance[i-1] < performance[i]:
			bonus[i] = bonus[i-1] + 1

	for i in range(count - 2, -1, -1):
		if performance[i+1] < performance[i]:
			bonus[i] = max(bonus[i], bonus[i+1] + 1)
	
	return bonus


Time: O(n) - two-pass
Space: O(n) - single output array generated

Takeaways:

Power of helper array created by [1]*len(performance). Also utilize reverse for loop. Watch for indices. Checking for max on second pass is becoming a theme.
